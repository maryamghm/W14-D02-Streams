# Lambda-and-functional-interfaces

## 1.1 Simple lamda example :
- Create the list and add elements into it. Use lambda function to print the element.



## 1.2 Write a java consumer example with lambda which returns print statement 3 times.
- Create consumer object and as a value mention print statement 3 times.
- Use the accept method of consumer and which accepts the value and performs the operation.



## 1.3.1 Write a java predicate example and print the numbers greater than 5 without using lambda.
- Create the list having random integer variables.
- Create a class which implements predicate
- write a boolean method which returns true for number greater than 5
- In the main class, create object of above class. Use the filter method and print the numbers.

)

## 1.3.2 Write the same predicate example using lambdas.
- Create the list having integers
- Use the lambda predicate expretion which makes code much shorter to filter the numbers which are greater than 5
- Print the numbers



## 1.4.1 Write program to demonstrate supplier interface with lambda.
- Use supplier interface and declare a string.
- Print teh string on console.



## 1.4.2 Create a custom class student and use supplier to supply new student object
- Create the student class and define the variables.
- Create student supplier  using supplier interface.
- Using get method of supplier interace , fetch the student object from student stupplier
- Print the result.



## 1.5.1 Create a custom class Employee and use comparator and its methods to sort the objects of employee
- Create Employee Class and declare properties ,getters and setters
- Create a main class and add few employee records
- Add those employees in list
- Use comparator sort method to sort the records
- Print the records



## 1.5.2 Create a custom class Employee and use comparator and its methods with the use of lambda
- Create Employee Class and declare properties ,getters and setters
- Create a main class and add few employee records
- Add those employees in list
- Use the lambda sort method to sort first ame and last name
- Print the record



## 1.6 Add list of integers in a list and use lambda and removeif method to demonstrate how it works.
- Create the list and add some integers
- Invoke the removeIf method on input with a lambda expression that checks if a number is even
- Print the result
